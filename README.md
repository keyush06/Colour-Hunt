# Colour-Hunt
We are all aware of the exceptional GUI capabilities of Tkinter. Python offers multiple options for developing GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI methods,
tkinter is the most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to 
create the GUI applications. 

So here I have created this colour game wherein yhe player would get 45 seconds and he will have to input the colour of the word. Easy right? But, here is the challenge, the words
are the names of the colours only. For example, if RED is flashed in GREEN on the screen then the player is supposed to input GREEN and not RED! The time frame and the hunger to score 
maximum makes it all the way more interesting.

### So, give it a try and let me know!
